                The Khoo Family Library is a living part of our family — a reflection of what shaped us,
                challenged us, and pushed us forward. Every shelf tells a story. Every book carries a memory.
                This library is where our curiosity was born and where it continues to burn today.

                <h2>Our Roots</h2>
                <p>
                    We come from a family that values learning the hard way: through reading, thinking,
                    questioning, and engaging deeply with the world. Books were never decorations — they were 
                    tools, companions, and guideposts. Over time, what began as a small personal collection
                    grew into something worth sharing.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Family Values</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> With ourselves, with our ideas, and with the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Asking better questions instead of chasing easy answers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work:</strong> Showing up, daily, to improve — even by a little.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect:</strong> For the thinkers who came before us and those who will come after.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Vision as a Family</h2>
                <p>
                    We built this library to keep our story alive — not through photos or archived moments, 
                    but through the ideas that changed us. As our family grows, the library grows with it. 
                    Each generation adds its own books, its own voice, its own mark.
                </p>

                <h2>A Place to Grow</h2>
                <p>
                    This isn’t just an archive. It’s a place of practice — a space for anyone in our family 
                    or circle of friends who wants to read seriously, think deeply, and carry that spirit into 
                    their own lives.
