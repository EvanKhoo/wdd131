            <p class="mission-intro">
                We built this library because books have always shaped us — not just as a world, 
                but as individuals. They record who we were, redefine who we are, and forge who we’re becoming. 
                Stories carry power. Knowledge carries weight. And access to both should belong to everyone.
            </p>

            <div class="mission-content">
                <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                <p>
                    The Khoo Family Library exists to make that power accessible. 
                    To preserve the ideas that shaped us. To spark curiosity in the next generation. 
                    To give anyone who walks through our doors — physically or digitally — the chance to learn, 
                    grow, imagine, and build something greater than themselves.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Principles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Knowledge should never be behind a gate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> We value questions that challenge and inspire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Reading is a practice — a commitment to growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Ideas deserve to live beyond the moment they're spoken.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Future</h2>
                <p>
                    This is just the beginning — a living, growing archive. 
                    New books, expanding collections, and eventually a full digital catalogue accessible to all 
                    who share our love for learning. One story at a time, we continue building something that lasts.
